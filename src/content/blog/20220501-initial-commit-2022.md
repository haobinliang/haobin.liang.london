description: Re-establishing my blog in 2022
---

Personal blog is something I drop and come back over and over again. The trigger is different each time; but the route to failure is the same:

```python
while see_an_inspiring_blog_design || \
    personal_blog_is_trendy || \
    i_have_an_urge_to_tell_the_world_something || \
    would_be_nice_to_have_a_blog_to_record_my_work || \
    would_be_nice_to_have_a_blog_to_record_my_life_events || \
    just_because:

    import most_popular_blogging_platform_this_year as platform_i_will_try from 'google'

    platform_i_will_try.remove("wordpress")

    for platform in platform_i_will_try:
        try:
            isSuccessful = trying_very_hard("git clone","yarn develop")
            if isSuccessful:
                deploy()
                break
        except:
            carry_on_with_life.sleep()
            pass
```

Oh yes, I missed one function.

```python
def trying_very_hard("blah","blah")
    return null
```
