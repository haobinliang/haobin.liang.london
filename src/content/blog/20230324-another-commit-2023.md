description: Rebooting my blog in 2023
---

A week ago, I received the domain renewal notification for liang.london (price = $39.16/Â£32.61 if you are interested). Only then I remembered that I had re-established my blog last year, thinking about writing more about life and work.

Instead of coming up with content, I spend quite some time trying out different new static site generators.

## [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

I always come back and try Hugo because of its extensions and themes. Strangely, it takes a few seconds to generate a page in dev mode. I must have done something wrong; but I don't bother to dig into it. So nah.

## [Next.js](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)

I used [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) by [timlrx](https://github.com/timlrx) in 2022, thinking I would style the blog myself. Apparently it didn't happen. I was trying to merge additional changes to my branch; but there're too many conflicts that I thought it might be easier to just restart.

## [Astro](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper)

Now I am settled with [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) by [satnaing](https://github.com/satnaing). Simple, easy and aesthetically pleasing - recently got into loving mono fonts. Also, the rendering and development is so much faster and easier than other frameworks. I am planning to stick with it until I find any reason to switch (or another fancy framework coming up - having my eyes on [Remix](https://remix.run/) at the moment).
