description: I've been reinstalling macOS quite a lot lately; but found myself searching for the same command lines over time.
---

```shell
## Nodejs and PNPM
brew install n # extremely convenient node version management
sudo n lts # use the latest lts, requires `sudo`
corepack enable # enable corepack to enable `pnpm`
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate # activate `pnpm`

## Misc tools
brew install ytdl-patched ffmpeg # video downloader and ffmpeg for video file post-processing

## Python
# `ytdl-patched` has a dependency on `python@3.11` (as of 1 April 2023) so I don't separately install Python

## Poetry
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
